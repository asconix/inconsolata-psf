# Inconsolata font in PSF format for VT

[Inconsolata](http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html) is a monospace font, designed for printed code listings and the like. Raph Lavien started the development of the regular style in 2006. Since this is my favorite font for any kind of text editing (coding, writing articles, etc.) my aim is to use it for Linux virtual consoles as well. This repo contains the font Inconsolata in PSF format which makes it possible.
